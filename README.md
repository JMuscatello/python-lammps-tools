# python-lammps-tools

This repository contains python code for the analysis of output files from  the LAMMPS parallel molecular dynamics simulator. 

It includes a Config class which is used to store and process atomic configuration data (positions, velocities).

NOTE: More documentation will be added to this repository in due course.
